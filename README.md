## Our Mission  
At **Ona Vision**, we strive to revolutionize real-time computer vision by making cutting-edge AI-powered detection and monitoring systems accessible, scalable, and efficient.  

## Our Vision  
To empower individuals, businesses, and communities with **state-of-the-art** object detection and recognition solutions that enhance safety, automation, and decision-making.  

## Core Values  
- **Innovation** ‚Äì Pushing the boundaries of AI and real-time processing.  
- **Efficiency** ‚Äì Optimizing performance for seamless, real-world applications.  
- **Accessibility** ‚Äì Bringing advanced vision technology to everyone, everywhere.  
- **Reliability** ‚Äì Ensuring accuracy and dependability in mission-critical scenarios.  

## What We Do  
Ona Vision integrates **YOLO-based object detection**, real-time **video streaming**, and **observability features** to provide insights that drive smarter, safer environments. Whether for security surveillance, industrial monitoring, or smart city applications, our solutions are built for high performance and scalability.  


## Overview
This project implements **real-time object detection** using **YOLOv8** and streams the processed video over a network. The server captures video from a webcam, performs object detection, and sends the processed frames to a client for display. Additionally, it integrates **observability features** using Prometheus to monitor system performance and model inference metrics.

## Features<img width="288" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 21 08 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8af478-e662-442b-8134-328dd323d44a" />

- Uses **YOLOv8** for state-of-the-art object detection
- **Real-time video processing** with OpenCV
- **Network streaming** using Python sockets
- **Bounding box rendering** with object labels
- **Observability integration** with Prometheus for:
  - FPS (Frames Per Second)
  - Inference time
  - CPU and memory usage
  - Detection confidence and per-class object count

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Socket Programming
- **Prometheus** for monitoring

## Setup Instructions

Install Libraries from requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the project
```bash
python download_model.py
```

Start webcam or other video feed
```bash
python main.py
```

Run this in a seperate terminal or tab to display real-time video analysis
```bash
python client.py
```

Metrics will be available at `http://localhost:8000/metrics`.

## How It Works
1. The **server** captures frames from the webcam and runs YOLOv8 for object detection.
2. Bounding boxes and labels are added to the frame.
3. The processed frame is serialized and sent to the **client** over a socket connection.
4. The **client** receives and displays the video in real-time.
5. **Prometheus metrics** are collected in the background, tracking performance and inference statistics.

## Observability Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **FPS** | Frames per second for performance monitoring |
| **Inference Time** | Time taken for YOLOv8 inference per frame |
| **CPU Usage** | System CPU utilization during processing |
| **Memory Usage** | System memory consumption during processing |
| **Detection Confidence** | Average confidence of detected objects per frame |
| **Class-wise Object Count** | Tracks the number of detected objects per class |

## Potential Improvements
- **Multi-object tracking** using DeepSORT
- **Edge deployment** on a Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano
- **Cloud integration** to store detection data
- **Web-based visualization** using Flask or FastAPI
