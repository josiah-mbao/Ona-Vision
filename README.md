## Overview

This project implements real-time object detection using YOLOv8 and streams the processed video over a network. The server captures video from a webcam, performs object detection, and sends the processed frames to a client for display. Additionally, it integrates observability features using Prometheus to monitor system performance and model inference metrics.

Ona Vision is a full MLOps pipeline, covering the complete lifecycle of a machine learning model, from training to deployment, monitoring, and scaling. It leverages Docker, Kubernetes, and GitOps to ensure a scalable and reliable production system for object detection and monitoring.

### The Inspiration

Ona Vision was born out of a frustrating and unfortunate experience I had. I lost‚Äîor possibly had‚Äîmy **AirPods stolen** at my university library. In an attempt to recover them, I spent nearly an hour in the CCTV office scrubbing through days of footage, trying to figure out what time I was at the library and if the AirPods could be spotted in any frame.

The process was tedious and inefficient. Manually reviewing security footage without any intelligent filtering or automation felt like looking for a needle in a haystack. Unfortunately, I never found my AirPods‚Äîbut I did walk away with an idea.

**Ona Vision** is my attempt to ensure others don‚Äôt have to go through that same helpless process. With object detection and tracking built in, this system can help people and institutions monitor and trace specific objects in real-time or recorded video streams. It‚Äôs my hope that this technology can make environments a little safer, and surveillance systems a lot smarter.


## Features
- Uses **YOLOv8** for state-of-the-art object detection
- **Real-time video processing** with OpenCV
- **Network streaming** using Python sockets
- **Bounding box rendering** with object labels
- **Observability integration** with Prometheus for:
  - FPS (Frames Per Second)
  - Inference time
  - CPU and memory usage
  - Detection confidence and per-class object count

## Web UI
You can now launch the detection system and view results from your browser using Flask.

### To Run the Web UI:
```bash
cd ui
python app.py
```
Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.


## Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) with DeepSORT

### What is DeepSORT?
DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracker) is an advanced object tracking algorithm that extends the original SORT tracker by adding deep learning-based appearance descriptors. This helps improve object re-identification across frames, making tracking more reliable in crowded or fast-moving scenes.

### Why Use DeepSORT?
- **Tracks multiple objects across frames** with consistent IDs.
- **Handles occlusions** (when objects overlap or disappear temporarily).
- **Re-identifies objects** even if they leave and re-enter the scene.
- **More accurate tracking** compared to basic object detection.

### How It Works in Ona Vision
1. **YOLOv8 detects objects** in each frame.
2. **DeepSORT assigns unique IDs** to detected objects.
3. **Tracks objects over time**, even if they move, overlap, or briefly disappear.
4. **Outputs tracking results** with bounding boxes and IDs.

### Performance Impact
- Adds a **small processing overhead** (~5-10% FPS drop).
- More stable tracking compared to detection-only mode.
- Ideal for **surveillance, traffic monitoring, and sports analytics**.


## Setup Instructions

Install Libraries from requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server which processes frames from webcam or other source
```bash
python main.py
```

Display real-time video
```bash
python client.py
```

### Web UI:
To launch the web UI, navigate to the "ui" directory and run:
```bash
cd ui
python app.py
```
Then visit http:localhost:5000 to view the results in browser.
Metrics will be available at `http://localhost:8000/metrics`.

## How It Works
1. The **server** captures frames from the webcam and runs YOLOv8 for object detection.
2. Bounding boxes and labels are added to the frame.
3. The processed frame is serialized and sent to the **client** over a socket connection.
4. The **client** receives and displays the video in real-time.
5. **Prometheus metrics** are collected in the background, tracking performance and inference statistics.

## Observability Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **FPS** | Frames per second for performance monitoring |
| **Inference Time** | Time taken for YOLOv8 inference per frame |
| **CPU Usage** | System CPU utilization during processing |
| **Memory Usage** | System memory consumption during processing |
| **Detection Confidence** | Average confidence of detected objects per frame |
| **Class-wise Object Count** | Tracks the number of detected objects per class |

## Potential Improvements
- **Multi-object tracking** using DeepSORT
- **Edge deployment** on a Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano
- **Cloud integration** to store detection data
- **Web-based visualization** using Flask or FastAPI
